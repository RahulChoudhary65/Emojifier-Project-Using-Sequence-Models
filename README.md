# Emojifier-Project-Using-Sequence-Models
Implemented the baseline model(Emojifier-V1) using Word embeddinmgs.
Built a more sophisticated model(Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM.
Described how negative sampling learns word vectors more efficiently than other words.
Built a sentiment classifier using word embeddings.
Built and train a more sophisticated classifier using an LSTM.
